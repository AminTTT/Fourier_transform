# Fourier_transform
In physics and mathematics, the Fourier transform (FT) is a transform that converts a function into a form that describes the frequencies present in the original function.
The output of the transform is a complex-valued function of frequency.
This codes get input function and give its Fourier transform. 
two above codes are written with 2 different methodes. once with "for LOOP" and another without it.
